I happened to come across it while researching something else, and it make me stop and try to figure out what was going on here.

This repo is a the code I used to reproduce Jeff's problem, and discover the solution.

It turns out the problem is not a bug in 'Chrome', but actually a 'bug' in PHP since the year 2000, [or at least continues to be debated as if it a bug or not](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=5415). 

It has to do with how PHP changes the Expires and max-age headers by default when you use the session_start() function.
